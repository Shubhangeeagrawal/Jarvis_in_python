Voice Assistant (Jarvis) in Python

This repository contains Python code for building a basic voice assistant similar to Jarvis from the Iron Man movies. The voice assistant can perform various tasks including:

-Providing current time and date
-Searching on Wikipedia
-Sending emails
-Searching on Chrome
-Taking screenshots
-Providing CPU usage and battery information
-Telling jokes
-Playing songs from the system

The voice assistant interacts with the user through speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion. It utilizes external libraries such as pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, pyautogui, psutil, and pyjokes for different functionalities.

Please note: Some functionalities like system commands for shutdown, restart, and logout are commented out by default for safety reasons.

Feel free to contribute and customize this voice assistant for your own use!
